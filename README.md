For channel testing

We are trying to simulate 1000+ users to register and stay online on XMPP in the same time. And we found Psi+ has the capability to create multiple accounts in the same client. All the accounts are stored in the same accounts.xml file. We will use some scripts (e.g. Python) to create those accounts and write to accounts.xml
